summary: New batteries for all kits

cost: 26 * sr2013_total_kits

description: >-
  We are intent on replacing our batteries with NiMH batteries (maybe
  even LiPo).

  This line is a last-minute hack: the budget needs to be submitted,
  but no-one has done the work to fully understand the battery
  situation.  The following points have been scraped together from
  the internets:
    - NiMH batteries are approximately 2.5 times as expensive as
      lead-acid.
    - Chargers are more expensive too.

  The price of this entry is based on the 12V NiMH batteries from here:
  http://www.component-shop.co.uk/html/body_nimh_flight_packs.html

  We will need to get chargers for these too.  However, this will jack
  the budget up quite considerably, and now is not a time to be doing
  that.  Therefore, I'm not going to include chargers in the budget,
  and something will have to be worked out later.

  Perhaps a solution is to replace our collection of chargers with
  ones that support lead-acid and NiMh.  This will allow us to ease
  our charging situation across (we'll need to stomp on teams
  losing/stealing chargers).  The at a later date we can replace the
  batteries.
