  We used to be able to claim back travel expenses from SCA/CV however they
  said that they're not willing to do this any more. The amount is based on
  what we would have claimed last year had the spreadsheet not missed of the
  travel expenses cell.

  This funding is _only_ for mentors travelling to team meetings.  It
  is not for mentors travelling to the competition, kickstart, or any
  other SR event.

  Bristol SCA is funding Bristol students travelling to schools, so they're
  not included in this funding pot.
