  Hosting of the Student Robotics website with linode.com for one year.
  During SR2014 we were charged at $40/month (their branding appears to
  changes fairly often), but had issues with server performance during
  the competition. It seems likely that we'll pay about the same for most
  of the year, but may want to spend some more for the duration of the
  competition.

  The number above is thus last year's overall cost with some allowance
  for competition specific costs.
