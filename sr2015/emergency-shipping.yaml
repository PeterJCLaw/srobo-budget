description: >-
  We occasionally have to ship things back and forth between teams
  when stuff breaks etc.  This fund is for the emergency shipping of
  things to and from teams, not for shipping kit to them.

  Our spend was Â£82 in SR2014, and it seems reasonable to expect that
  our spend will scale up a bit for SR2015.
