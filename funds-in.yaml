    # This is a partial installment of the total that the Motorola
    # Foundation gave us for SR2013-14.  At the time of injecting this
    # installment, it's the value of the sr2013/competition tree,
    # which is somewhat desperately needed right now for spending.
    # The rest of the money will be injected into the budget master
    # branch at a later date, replacing this entry with the full
    # amount.
