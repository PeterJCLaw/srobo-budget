description: >-
  Carpet for the SR2014 arenas.

  Rolls of this in blue:
    http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/190594523558

    - 2 of 18x4m rolls
    - 1 of 9x4m rolls

  The 9x4m roll will have to be cut longways in 2.
  Carpet is £355.13 all in.

  Tape:
    Low tack: http://www.tapes-direct.co.uk/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=134&products_id=766
    Medium tack: http://www.tapes-direct.co.uk/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=134&products_id=765

    If we place a strip of that every 500mm across the arena, then
    that'd be 171m (for a 9x9m carpet), or 4 x 50m rolls per arena.

    So 8 rolls total.

    Since we don't know whether we want low or medium tack without
    being at the venue, we should get both.

    £4.95 delivery for tape.
