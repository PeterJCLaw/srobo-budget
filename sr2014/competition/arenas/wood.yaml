  Wood for the arenas.

  We've got enough pine for two arenas.

  We need more faced hardboard.
  One arena needs 64m (that's 32m inside and outside). So we need to
  have 128m total.  Add 10% for spare parts, and we need 140.8m
  total.

  We currently have 57m worth.  So we need to buy 83m worth.  So we
  need to purchase 83/2.4 = 34.6 sheets -> 35 sheets.

  Wickes sells 1.2m x 0.6m sheets, which are half that size, so we
  actually need 70 of them.  Also, these will fit in Rob's car, so he
  can collect them from Wickes easily.
