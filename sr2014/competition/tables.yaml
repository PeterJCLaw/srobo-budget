  Hire of some trestle tables for the competition.

  These are required as Newbury has only just enough for the team
  pits.  We will need some for our own purposes.

  This is a moderately educated guess.  We can collect these from a
  local hire company, and take them to the venue.  Most places charge
  £4 or £5 for a trestle table for a week.
