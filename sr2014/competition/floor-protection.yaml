  Protecta Shield Standard:
    http://www.protectascreen.com/Catalogue/Floor-Protection/Hard-Floor-Protection/Protecta-Shield-Standard-182m-x-55m-x-125-micron-104-018

    13.4 x 58.6m area to be covered (not helpdesk area)
    Comes in 1.82 x 55m rolls.

    Assuming 100mm overlap between strips, this means 7.79 strips are
    required along the length of the room.  Rounds up to 8.

    Since it comes in 55m rolls, this will leave a 3.6m x 13.4m gap at
    the end of the room.  This can be covered by 2 strip-widths, and
    will only require one more roll.

    So 9 rolls total are required.  Add one spare.
    Rolls are £75.20 + VAT each.
    Delivery is free.

  Also requires two types of tape:

    - Double sided tape for adhering to carpet
      Assuming 3 strips of this along the length of each strip of all
      the plastic that we buy, we need 1650m of this stuff!
      That's 33 x 50m rolls.  (Includes spare because of spare strip)

      Not 100% on what this will be yet, but potentially this:

      £7.45 per roll.

    - Joining tape to secure edges down
      Since each strip will overlap the top of its neighbour, only one
      piece of joining tape is required per protection strip.  Of
      course, there'll be one strip at the edge that requires 2 pieces
      of joining tape.
      So that's 11 * 55 = 605m of this stuff.
      Or 13 x 50m rolls.
