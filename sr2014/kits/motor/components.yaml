  USB motor board assembly.

  All of our motor boards are being replaced with USB motor boards for
  SR2014.

  Based on the cost of the components for the v2 boards plus a little bit due
  to using a monolithic H-bridge IC which might work out slightly more
  expensive. See https://www.studentrobotics.org/trac/wiki/Kits/2011.
