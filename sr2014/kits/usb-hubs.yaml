  USB hubs for the SR2014 kits.

  This is a pessimistic allocation.  I sincerely hope that we can find
  a cheaper hub that is robust.  There are cheaper hubs out there.
  For example, Xenta do a 10 port hub that's around Â£6.  Unfortunately
  it gets terrible reviews.

  This is based on buying a D-Link 7-port hub from ebuyer:
