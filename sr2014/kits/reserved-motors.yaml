  This line may *not* be claimed against.

  We're not manufacturing the "new" USB motor controller in SR2012,
  because it's not ready yet.  Instead, we hope to manufacture them in
  SR2013.  This blob of money is the amount that we have left from the
  SR2012 motor controller budget after manufacturing enough "old"
  motor controllers to see us through SR2013.

  Once the Motorola app (submitted in 2012) has arrived, this will be
  reassigned to the manufacture of the sr2014 motor controllers.
