  http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idProduct=8932

  We're replacing all of our batteries, since the old ones weren't
  that great.

  Includes VAT and import duty.  My best guess right now of import
  duty is 2.7%.  This is assuming the batteries fall under the
  commodity code 8548909099.
